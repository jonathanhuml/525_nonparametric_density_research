The majority of this project was completed in Matlab. First, upload everything to the Matlab workspace.

Second, run clusters.m and kldiv.m
Next run the research_project.m file. This contains the actual optimization process used in the paper. 

The eda html file was ran in R, not Matlab. I included an html file instead a markdown file so that you could see my outputs without having to download and run R files. The clustering portion of the paper was completed in R, not Matlab. All of the graphs and tables were completed with ggplot and kable in R. I think they look nicer than the standard Matlab output.
